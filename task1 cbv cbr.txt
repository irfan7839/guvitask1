Copy by value:
         primitive data types are peformed by copy by value. 
         There are five primitive data types- Boolean,null,undefined,String,Number.
       CODE:
          var a=10;                        
          var b=a;                           
          a=20;                                     
          console.log(b);                    
                                                        
         O/P: a=20
                  b=10
     
         Here when we re-assign value to a  the value of b didn't change.



Copy by Reference:
            Non-primitive data types are performed by copy be Reference.
            Array,Object,Function are Non-primitive data types.
           CODE:
            var arr1=[1,2,3];
            var arr2=arr1;
              arr2[0]=10;
             console.log(arr2);
            console.log(arr1);

          O/P: arr2 =[10,2,3]
                   arr1 =[10,2,3]

              Here Both pointer arr1 and arr2 are refering to same address.
